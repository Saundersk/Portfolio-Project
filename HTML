                            <p>I believe HTML is the primary weapon in any Front End Web Develepors armory. This was my
                                first language and fisrt exposure to code. At the time of only knowing HTML, it
                                completely blew my mind!<br>Used in all of my Front End projects.</p>

                            <p>Shortly following the courses in HTML I discovered CSS and yet again my mind was blown
                                with how extravagant I could make what was once a boring and plain markup. I was amazed
                                at the power this language packed!<br>Used in all of my Front End Projects.</p>

                            <p>Following CSS I came to a fork in the road where I found the argument JavaScript vs
                                Python. At the time my own study and research pointed to Python being the easier
                                language to learn with limited exposure to code and programming. As soon as I started
                                learning I was hooked. The courses I completed on this language had me building games
                                such as Blackjack and Tic Tac Toe as well as small programs, For example a banking
                                program that allowed for entry of usernames/passwords as well as deposit, withdrawal
                                and current balance. Very excited about this language and the possibilities it
                                presents. </p>

                    <p><strong>Hi</strong>,<br>My name is Kasey Saunders. I recently found web development and dove
                        head first into
                        learning everything I could. I started with HTML then graduated to CSS and then found myself
                        blown away at what I discovered in Python. I have spent my entire life addicted to everything
                        web as a consumer and only recently found it was possible to join the fleet of
                        Developers/Programmers. I am very excited for this oppurtunity to do something I'm passionate
                        about and hopefully make a difference in the world. My short term goal is to become a
                        Developer. My long term goal is to become a programmer and contribute to help Veterans or to
                        take my love of Fitness/Nutrition to help people reach their fitness/health goals. Outside of
                        learning to write code I enjoy spending time with my family that seems to be growing up in the
                        blink of an eye. I love sports, competition, fitness/strength training, PC gaming.<br>If we
                        share any passions please feel free to join my <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/eMxMfnJ"><strong>Discord</strong></a>
                        where you can often find me acting as a
                        sponge and soaking up all the information I can from more seasoned developers or raging
                        in Counter Strike: Global Offensive.</p>
